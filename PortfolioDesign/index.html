        <img src="images/me.png" alt="Picture of Torie Szczech, the face behind VSCheck Photography.">
        <p>My name is Victoria (Torie) Szczech adn I am 20 years old. I'm a second semester sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, and I am majoring in Psychology and minoring in Multimedia Communication. I love to spend time with my boyfriend, niece and nephews, and loved ones.</p>
        <p>I have always had a love for capturing memories through a lense (my camera roll can account for that). I started talking pictures when I was in elementary school and since then it seems like I can't put the camera down. In my senior year of high school I was Editor-in-Chief of the Yearbook Staff, which meant I was in charge of overseeing everything from pictures, to editing, to finalizing every page. I graduated at the top of my class while being Editor-in-Chief for Yearbook, president of Student Council, Vice President of NHS, and was a member of FFA and FBLA. More recently, after having a very hard Sophomore year in college, I decided that I wanted to really put my heart into what I truly loved: photography. So, I put down my moms camera that I had been using for years and decided to make a big girl purchase and buy my own camera. From there I started my journey as VSCheck Photography.</p>
        <p>Right now, in addition to starting up my photography business, I work part time at a boutique in my hometown, Broadway Boutique, where I manage the social media, and I help customers find clothing they feel beautiful in.</p>
        <p>I'll step you through the name behind "VSCheck Photography." The "VS" are my initials, "Victoria Szczech." The "Check" is how you say my last name 'Szczech.' Yep, just like a check mark; it's very decieving. Which is why my logo is shaped like a check mark. Then "Photography" is just my interest so that's why that is in my name.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking time out of your day to look at my portfolio and I hope you enjoy all the photos as much as I do!!</p>
